# DS-ML-Capstone-Project

Since I never got IBM stuff to properly work, the SQL tasks of the project
were executed on localhost through SQLite3, in the SQL folder you can see the 
.csv files used (one was converted due to the date being in other order with
a script that's uploaded there as well). In the SQL folder there is Command screenshots
folder. There you can see the actual commands used and the results.
